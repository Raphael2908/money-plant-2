# Goal
Create a subscription tracker app that will list out your subscriptions, track when is the next payment and allow for some customisation and categorisation 

# Learning Points
1. javascript dates are a pain to work with ( check your variable types) 
2. I should use typescript because wrong types keep causing issues that I take hours to solve. See above point
3. Error handling is not as bad as I thought it would be
4. Only use dependencies if required

# Time investment:
Est 3 weekends
8hr coding blocks max / day
~ 48 hrs

# Thoughts
The app did not turn out as well as I thought it would be. I would say that this was because of the learning curve with react native. 
I hoped to have a budget tracker section initially with a pie chart and other features like notion customisability and an iPhone edit mode
